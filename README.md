# ðŸ’¢ Super-heroes game
 
This project was conceived by Dev em Dobro like an html and css challenge

But I take it like a JavaScript challenge and I built on my own using:

ðŸŸ¡ JavaScript library: [React](https://reactjs.org/)

ðŸ”· Framework for styling: [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)

To run this project:

In the main directory of the project, you can 

â¬‡

  `cd heroes-game` 
  
  â¬‡

  `npm run dev` 
  
  â¬‡

now this app will run on the http://localhost:3000/
